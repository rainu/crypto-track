# Config

Each configuration can set over the environment variables. For example: if we want to set
the **server.port**, we have to define a environment variable named **CFG_SERVER_PORT**. So the
environment variable starts with **CFG_** followed by the "config_path". Where the config path
is UPPER-Case and each dot (.) have to be replaced with underscore (_).
